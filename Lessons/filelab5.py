'''
A photographer is organizing a photo collection about the national 
parks in the US and would like to annotate the information about 
each of the photos into a separate set of files. Write a program 
that reads the name of a text file containing a list of photo file 
names. The program then reads the photo file names from the text 
file, replaces the "_photo.jpg" portion of the file names with 
"_info.txt", and outputs the modified file names.

Assume the unchanged portion of the photo file names contains only 
letters and numbers, and the text file stores one photo file name 
per line. If the text file is empty, the program produces no 
output.
'''# Type your code here.
file_name = input()
with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip().replace('photo.jpg', 'info.txt' ))
