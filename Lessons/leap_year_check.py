'''A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. 
In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. 
To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. 
A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. 
The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

1) The year must be divisible by 4
2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be 
evenly divisible by 400; therefore, both 1700 and 1800 are not leap years
Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a 
leap year.
